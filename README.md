 Example Docker Compose Web App

Simple Python web application running on Docker Compose. 
The application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis. 

Make sure you have already installed both Docker Engine and Docker Compose. 
You donâ€™t need to install Python or Redis, as both are provided by Docker images.
